agent_double:
Uses the board completely "raw" (no encoding at all)

agent_onehot: (This is the neural network we're turning in)
Uses one hot encoding to warp the board to a vector of size 832.
This is the bset one yet!!!!!!!!!! (about 80% win ratio and is very stable)
Is stored in 'saved_net_one'

agent_one_tseFeat:
Uses one hot encoding for the actor but Tsesauros features for the critic.
This one is really bad!!!!!!!!!!!!
